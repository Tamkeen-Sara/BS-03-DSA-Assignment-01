Approach
Task 1
The approach to solving Task 1 involved:

Problem Analysis: Breaking down the problem into smaller parts to understand the core requirements.
Data Structure Selection: Choosing an appropriate data structure, such as an array or linked list, to implement the solution efficiently.
Algorithm Design: A step-by-step design of the algorithm, including sorting, searching, and traversal where applicable.
Implementation: The solution was implemented using C++ with a focus on readability and efficiency.
Task 2
The approach to solving Task 2 followed these steps:

Problem Analysis: ...
Data Structure Selection: ...
Algorithm Design: ...
Implementation: ...
(Repeat for all tasks)

Assumptions
Several assumptions were made during the implementation of the solutions:

Valid Inputs: It is assumed that all input provided to the program is valid, meaning no additional validation checks are required.
Resource Availability: Assumed that enough system resources (memory and processing power) are available to handle the input size within the problem's constraints.
Platform Independence: The solution is written in C++ and assumes that the environment can compile and run standard C++ code without issues.
Challenges Faced
Task 1
Optimization Issues: Finding the most efficient way to solve the problem with minimal time complexity was challenging, especially when dealing with large datasets.
Memory Management: Ensuring that memory usage was optimized and avoiding memory leaks was particularly difficult while handling dynamic memory in C++.
Task 2
Edge Cases: Some edge cases, such as extremely small or large input values, required additional consideration and handling.
Debugging Recursive Functions: Debugging recursive solutions was complex due to the nested call structure.
